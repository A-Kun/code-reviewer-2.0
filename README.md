## description of the project

There are 5 stages of each work:

1. My Works

2. Review My Own Work
	Students review their own code, similar to proof reading when submitting a paper
	They try to identify the "weakness" of their own code

3. Review My Peers
	Students review their peers' code
	Students may find cleaner/better solutions

4. How My Code is Reviewed
	Students check their peers/TA's feedback of their code
	
5. Quality of My Reviews

Note: instructors may opt-out any stages
